Pseudocode for Monitoring System
# Step 1: Read Configuration File
configurations = read_config("feed_config.json")
# Step 2: Get Current Execution Time and Business Day
current_time = get_current_time()
current_business_day = get_business_day(current_time)  # Adjust based on FICC Calendar
# Step 3: Iterate through Each Feed Configuration
for feed in configurations:
# Extract Feed Parameters
    start_time = feed["start"]
    end_time = feed["end"]
    frequency = feed["frequency"]  # Can be -1 (one-time) or periodic
    offset = feed["offset"]["hours"] if "hours" in feed["offset"] else feed["offset"]["minutes"]
    table_name = feed["snowflake_table"]
    business_date_column = feed["columns"]["business_date"]
    slice_column = feed["columns"].get("slice_id", None)
    business_calendar = feed["conditions"].get("BUS_DT_calendar", None)
# Step 4: Determine Applicable Time for Checking Feeds
    check_time = start_time + offset  # Expected feed availability time
# Step 5: Verify if Current Execution Time Falls Within Monitoring Window
    if current_time >= check_time and current_time <= end_time:
        
        # Determine Business Day for Query
        business_day_offset = feed["conditions"]["BUS_DT"]
        target_business_day = calculate_business_day_offset(current_business_day, business_day_offset, business_calendar)
        
        # Step 6: Construct Query to Check Feed in Snowflake
        query = f"""
            SELECT COUNT(*) 
            FROM {table_name} 
            WHERE {business_date_column} = '{target_business_day}'
        """
        
        # If a slice ID exists, check specific slice
        if slice_column:  
            slice_id = calculate_slice_id(current_time)  # Compute expected slice ID
            query += f" AND {slice_column} = '{slice_id}'"
# Step 7: Execute Query in Snowflake
        feed_count = execute_snowflake_query(query)
        
        if feed_count == 0:
            # Step 8: If Feed is Missing, Trigger Alert
            send_alert(feed["email_dist"], f"Missing feed in {table_name} for {target_business_day} at {current_time}")
# Step 9: Log Execution Completion
log_event("Feed Monitoring Execution Completed")

Key Features of This Pseudocode
	1. Configuration-Driven Execution
		○ Reads configurations dynamically to support multiple feeds.
		○ Supports different business calendars (e.g., FICC) and offset handling.
	2. Time-Based Evaluation
		○ Determines the expected feed arrival time based on start + offset.
		○ Ensures it only checks feeds after the delay period has passed.
	3. Business Day Handling
		○ Automatically adjusts the business date based on offset logic.
		○ Uses calculate_business_day_offset() to determine the correct business day based on FICC Calendar.
	4. Intraday & End-of-Day Handling
		○ If slice ID exists, it checks individual time-sliced feeds.
		○ If end-of-day monitoring, it only looks at final EOD records.
	5. Alerting Mechanism
		○ If feed is missing, it triggers an alert only once per missing entry.

Example Scenarios & How the System Handles Them
Scenario	Config Start	Offset	Check Time	Business Date Handling	Outcome
End of Day Check	14:00	3 hours	17:00	Business Day -1	If feed is missing at 17:00, send alert
Intraday Check	08:00	30 min	08:30	Business Day 0	If 08:30 feed is missing, send alert
High-Frequency Check	09:00	15 min	09:15	Business Day 0	If 09:15 feed is missing, send alert
Weekend Handling	Friday 10 PM	3 hours	Saturday 1 AM	Business Day -1	Final EOD check runs for Friday on Saturday

Next Steps
	1. Convert this pseudocode into a Python script.
	2. Integrate Snowflake database queries for execution.
3 . Implement logging and alerting mechanisms.
