Replace S3-based monitoring with database queries to check if expected data is present at the correct time.
Monitor must check Start-of-Day (SOD), Intraday, and End-of-Day (EOD) slices separately.
If data for a given slice is missing at the expected time, raise an alert.
Implement a sliding window mechanism to avoid rechecking confirmed data.
If today is a business day after a holiday, check the last available business dayâ€™s data.
Initially, check only data presence; later, introduce data validation checks (e.g., expected record counts).

Final Outcome
A monitoring script running on a schedule.
A configuration file defining expected data.
Logs and alerts notifying about missing data.
Documentation explaining how it works.
