After discussing this with Craig, he suggested the following approach:

Create a virtual environment to isolate the testing process.
Take the existing (current) versions of the libraries and attempt to upgrade them to the fixed versions.
Verify if the libraries function as expected without breaking any dependencies.
I will proceed with this approach and provide updates based on my findings. Let me know if there are any additional checks or steps youâ€™d like me to include.
