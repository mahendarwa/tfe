request to Update KMS Key Application ID to Match S3 Bucket
Description:
The S3 bucket rql-tfstate-prod is currently using a KMS key (ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:043956502342:key/e18ee1e3-6953-4633-be55-15c05802f73a) that has an Application ID of "RQL", while the S3 bucket has an Application ID of "ARI".

As per the compliance findings, the Application ID of the KMS key should match the Application ID of the S3 bucket to align with security policies.

Remediation Steps Requested:
Update the KMS keyâ€™s Application ID tag from "RQL" to "ARI".

KMS Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:043956502342:key/e18ee1e3-6953-4633-be55-15c05802f73a
