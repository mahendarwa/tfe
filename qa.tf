Please find attached two screenshots for reference:

Screenshot 1: Shows the AKS cluster login details â€” who accessed the cluster and from where.

Screenshot 2: Shows the container-level activity (e.g., when a user connects via kubectl exec and performs actions like file creation, deletion, etc.).

We need to discuss how we can integrate both these views into a single query for better visibility.
Please let me know your availability so we can connect tomorrow with Satish to go over this.
