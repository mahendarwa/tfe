While testing the FIM rule, we noticed two issues —
Email alerts are not triggering consistently (delay varies between 1–10 mins).
Recursive file changes under /var/** or /etc/** are not always detected.
We’ll need to raise a support case with Wiz to confirm if this is expected behavior or a configuration limitation.



Hi Wiz Support,
We’re noticing FIM alerts triggering inconsistently (1–10 min delay) and not detecting recursive file changes under /var/** or /etc/**. Could you confirm if nested path monitoring and consistent alert timing are fully supported in Runtime FIM or if configuration adjustments are needed?
