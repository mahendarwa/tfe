Subject: Planned Renaming of Anaconda, Python 3.6/3.8 on Dev Servers â€“ Action Required

As discussed, we are planning to rename the Anaconda folder and Python 3.6 / 3.8 directories on the development servers as part of -------

Objective:
To hide Anaconda and older Python versions (3.6/3.8) to validate if any applications still rely on them.
We aim to shift all environments to Python 3.9+ which is already available on EC2 servers.
This change will help us identify dependencies and move towards a cleaner, license-compliant setup (Anaconda now requires a paid license).


Initial Action:

Rename Anaconda, Python 3.6, and Python 3.8 root directories to something like _old on one development server.
No deletion will be done initially. This allows us to easily revert if needed.

Testing & Monitoring:
All applications should be rebuilt and tested using Python 3.9 or 3.11.

Collaboration Required:
Development teams should verify their applications function properly without Anaconda.
Please coordinate with us if you encounter any issues post renaming.
