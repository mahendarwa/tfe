Unable to Create Automation Rule – "Add Action" is Blank, Integrations Missing

While attempting to create an automation rule for policy update notifications (CCR, Graph Q, and new releases), the “Add Action” section appears blank. We are unable to see existing integrations like Splunk HEC and Email in the dropdown.

Additionally, the message "Preview is not available" appears when using the Release after filter, which might be contributing to the issue.
No actions are displayed. Can’t complete rule creation.
We expect to see available integrations such as Email and Splunk HEC in the Add Action section.
