Until the root cause is clearly identified, and given that this sudden spike appears to be linked to a recent change in Wizâ€™s detection logic (starting July 14th), can we temporarily suppress or disable this specific container policy? Since the vendor themselves are still investigating and believe this should have been detected from Day 1, a temporary action will help reduce alert noise and avoid false positives while the issue is under review.
