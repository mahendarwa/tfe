2. processS3File
Purpose:
Reads a file from S3 line-by-line, filters lines by regex patterns, constructs Splunk event JSON, and sends batched data via pushDataToSplunk.

Parameters:
bucket, key: Source S3 bucket and object key.

Key Logic:
Matches file name against file_pattern in splunk_props.
Skips file if skip_file_pattern matches.
Reads lines from file, filtering:
Empty lines → skip.
Lines matching drop_event_pattern → skip.
For valid lines:
Extracts event_time from line if regex pattern is provided, else uses current timestamp.
Constructs JSON event with time, index, source, sourcetype, host, event.
Batches events up to max_request_size_bytes.
On batch size exceeded or EOF: sends to Splunk via pushDataToSplunk.
