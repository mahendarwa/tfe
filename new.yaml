You're right—it is technically still a violation. However, since Wiz only started detecting this due to a recent backend change (July 14th), and the vendor themselves are still investigating why it wasn't flagged earlier, there's a chance it could be an issue with detection logic or severity classification. The idea behind temporary suppression is just to reduce unnecessary alert noise until we confirm whether this is something we truly need to act on. We can always re-enable once there’s clarity.
