I checked the resources in Wiz where the Excel sheet shows tags as None. For those resources, I validated both in Wiz and directly in the cloud console, and I did not find any tag information.
For resources where the Excel sheet does show tags, I was able to confirm that the same tags are visible in Wiz as well.

To conclude:
There is no issue with Wiz ingestion.
Tags are missing from the cloud resource itself, which is why they appear as None in the Excel export.
Example:
Resource with tag present → [screenshot/reference]
Resource with no tag → [screenshot/reference]
