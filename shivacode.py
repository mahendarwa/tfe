Hi Fernando,

Thanks for the update. However, we’re seeing hundreds of similar internal errors (J002/J003) every day across multiple scans — regardless of whether they eventually succeed in subsequent runs.

Could you please check if there’s any permanent fix that can be implemented from your end to prevent these internal errors from occurring in the first place? If there are any actions or configuration changes needed from our side, please let us know as well.

We’d like to understand how this can be addressed proactively instead of waiting for the next successful scan.
