Follow-Up: Visio License Activation Request

Hi Oscar,

I’m following up on my request for assistance with activating Visio. I have installed the application, but it still shows as unlicensed when I open it.

It has been a couple of weeks since I raised this request, and I’ve also sent follow-up messages on chat without a response. Could you please let me know when you will be able to help in resolving this issue, either by providing a license key or activating Visio?

Your assistance on this would be appreciated.
