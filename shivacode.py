Thanks everyone for the support on this.

Azure (Adam) has confirmed everything looks good.
GCP (Michael) also validated on Teams; please let us know if any additional review is needed.
AWS (Raja) confirmed all flagged accounts are inactive for 180 days.

Hi Raja,
As discussed, please go ahead and submit the request, attaching this email, to promote the 180-day custom policies and demote the respective OOTB policies.
