In the “Failed scans by Resource Region” report, the dashboard is showing failed scans for the last 5 days, even though there were no errors during that period. The failures are shown across multiple regions, including Azure (CentralUS, EastUS2) and GCP (us-east4).

Could you please confirm why these errors are appearing retroactively when they were not present earlier, and also check if there are any active errors now?
