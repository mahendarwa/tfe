Wiz has flagged a weak password for the local user Btheerth on the listed Azure VMs. As the Wiz platform admin, I don’t have OS-level access to perform local password changes; this remediation needs to be completed by the respective Azure VM/application owner in line with CVS password complexity standards.

Once the password is updated, we’ll monitor the Wiz rescan and confirm closure of the finding.
