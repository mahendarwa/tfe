: FIM Changes Not Detected in AKS Cluster Container

Hi Eamon,

We have enabled Agentless File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) in our environment.
As part of our testing, we made some changes under the /etc/ path inside a container running in our AKS cluster and triggered a manual scan.

However, even after waiting 24 hours, no detection alerts were triggered in Wiz.
