Just to confirm — these exclusions for /var/log/pods (read-only) and /var/lib/otelcol (read/write) mean that if any pod from the o11y-collectors namespace accesses them, no alert will be generated, but if any other namespace (for example, a pod from default or test) tries to modify or write under /etc, /usr, /root, /opt, or even /etc/hosts, an alert should still trigger, right?
