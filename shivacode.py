We’ve seen this issue earlier as well. Even though the message appears on the screen, you’ll still be able to view all the properties and available options. From our experience, this looks like a Viz-related bug — it usually clears up automatically. The message itself doesn’t block access to any specific item or functionality, and you can still view everything on that page. If you can’t view anything from that page, please do let me know.
