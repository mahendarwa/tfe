Understand that /Partition=68168BD6/ ≈ C:\ or another drive

That “Partition” ID is an internal volume ID used by the scanner.

It usually refers to your main drive (like C:\), unless you have multiple volumes.

Convert the path manually
Take the path from your report and remove the partition prefix.
Example:
/Partition=68168BD6/ProgramData/AppDynamics/MachineAgent/extensions/ServerMonitoring/lib/commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar
becomes

C:\ProgramData\AppDynamics\MachineAgent\extensions\ServerMonitoring\lib\commons-beanutils-1.9.
