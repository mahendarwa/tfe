We noticed an inconsistency in the scan failure reporting. Specifically, for Aug 21, no errors were visible yesterday, but today the dashboard is showing failures for that date (regions: Eastus2 (Azure), us-east1 & us-east4 (AWS)).

Could you please confirm if the scan results are designed to reflect with a 24-hour delay due to data loading or processing? We want to ensure that this is expected behavior and not an issue with the reporting logic.

Looking forward to your clarification.
