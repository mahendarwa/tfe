I noticed that several scans are failing with internal errors (Internal-W001) across multiple projects in the All_GCP_CVS_Org__Outpost connector. The issue appears to be on the backend, as the failures are consistent and not related to any specific resource configuration.

Could you please check on your side if there is anything wrong at the Wiz backend that may be causing these internal errors?

Attaching a screenshot for reference.
