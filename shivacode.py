Subject: No Email Triggered from Wiz Sign-In (noreply@app.wiz.io
)

Hi Team,

We are facing an issue where the sign-in verification email from Wiz (noreply@app.wiz.io) is not being triggered.
Our internal email server team has confirmed that no email traffic is observed from Wiz to our domain (@cvshealth.com) during the login attempts.

Please help verify whether the email generation from Wiz’s end is functioning correctly for the below user:

User: Lakshminarayanan.Dhanushkodi@CVSHealth.com

Let us know if there are any tenant-level settings or configurations that might be preventing the email from being sent.
