Since Mason is not responding, can we request temporary Gembox access so we can reach the AKS cluster’s isolated domain and run the required pod/ACR connectivity tests ourselves?
He only needs to allow our IP so we can log into Gembox and execute the commands directly, which will speed up the troubleshooting.
