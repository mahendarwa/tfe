We already capture this information in Tableau through the weekly ingestion from Wiz and send out scorecards accordingly.
If you are not part of those emails, please let us know — we can add you so you receive the weekly updates.

We can also provide you access to Tableau, where you can view and download reports specific to your LOB or cloud provider.

If you have any questions, we can schedule some time with Satish to walk you through it.
