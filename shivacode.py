Follow-Up: Issue Trend View Not Displaying When Filtering by Specific Cloud Platform

Hi Team,

I am following up on a support request I raised a couple of days ago but haven’t received any response yet.

In the Wiz tool, under Issues, I selected a specific filter (rule) which is a Security Graph Query spanning multiple clouds — meaning it generates issues across multiple cloud platforms.

If I do not filter by Cloud Platform, I can see the Open and Resolved trending chart. However, when I filter by a specific Cloud Platform (e.g., Azure), the trending chart is not displayed, even though there are issues present for that platform.

Could you please confirm if this is expected behavior or if there is a way to enable the trending view for a specific cloud platform when a cross-cloud rule is selected?

Screenshots are attached for reference.
