We worked with Wiz support to create and validate the custom policy. The validation results look correct â€” the OOTB policy shows 173 issues, while the custom one reports 167 issues.
We verified that the difference (6 AWSReserved + 1 CSS account) is expected due to the exclusions applied.

Please review and proceed to raise a SNOW request to promote this custom policy.
