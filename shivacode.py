Frequent VM Scan Failures – Error Code Internal-J002 (Azure EastUS2 Region)

Body:
Hi Wiz Support Team,

We’ve observed multiple VM workload scans failing across the Azure EastUS2 region. All affected resources show the same error message — “Internal-J002” — under the scan logs (screenshot attached).

Could you please help us understand the root cause of these Internal-J002 failures and advise any remediation or configuration changes required on our end?
