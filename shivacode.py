Hi Team,

We noticed an inconsistency in the scan failure reporting. Specifically, for Aug 21, no errors were visible yesterday, but today the dashboard is showing failures for that date (regions: Eastus2 (Azure), us-east1 & us-east4 (AWS)).

This also happened previously — no errors were visible for 6–7 days, and then failures appeared retroactively for those dates.

Could you please confirm if this delay is expected behavior (due to data loading/processing) or if there is an issue with the reporting logic?
