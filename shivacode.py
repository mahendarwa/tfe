I'm reviewing how Security Scores are visualized in the dashboard and see that a score of 90% is shown in green. The formula only generates the numeric score and doesnâ€™t specify color logic. Could you please confirm the official thresholds used to determine when the score turns green, yellow/orange, or red?
