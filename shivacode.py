I am facing errors while executing the content processing script, due to naming discrepancies.

For example:
The script expects MV_Docs_Q12025, whereas the available directory is Model_Docs_Q12025/.
Similarly, it looks for Updated_Negligible_Model_Risk_Memo.pdf, but the actual file name is Updated Negligible Model Risk Memo - Content Generation and Insights.pdf.
Could you please review the paths and advise on the next steps?
