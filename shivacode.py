Hi [Name],

From our side, I can see that the **non-OS disk** scan has completed successfully, but the **OS disk** scan has not yet run.  

If you have any findings or reports related to the **non-OS disk**, please collect the report from Kurt and remove the related files accordingly.  

If the issue is related to the **OS disk**, we’ll need to wait — I’ve already raised a support case with Wiz to check why the OS disk hasn’t been scanned yet.



=-=======================
Hi Wiz Support,

We’re seeing that for VM **MAZQGRCFS01R1**, the non-OS disks were scanned successfully (latest runs were 3–5 hours ago), 
but the OS disk scan has not been performed for the last 3 days.

Expected behavior: OS disk should be scanned within the 24-hour interval as per configuration.

Could you please check why the OS disk scan is delayed or skipped, 
and confirm if any agent/configuration issue needs to be corrected?

Attaching screenshot for reference.
