The Threat Detection rules in Wiz are created and managed by the vendor, so we do not have the ability to edit or modify them directly.

However, if there are specific Threat Detection findings that are eligible for exceptions, we have the option to create Ignore Rules to move those findings into an ignored state. This helps ensure that only valid and actionable threats remain visible while exceptions are properly tracked.
