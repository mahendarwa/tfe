Connected with Willy and gathered all inputs regarding BSD Monitoring.
Received a suggestion to leverage the existing BSD Monitoring and add the required enhancements.
Development server was completely down for the last two days, delaying the start of the script.
Worked with the Cloud Ops team to resolve the issue while reviewing the BSD Monitoring code and preparing documentation.
Now able to access the development server but cannot switch to the apadmin user.
Do not seem to have the necessary permissions for apadmin.
Identified the required AD groups and am in the process of raising a request for access.
Once access is granted, will proceed with implementing the enhancements.
