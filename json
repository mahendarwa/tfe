As part of a recent non-compliance report, we have identified several IAM roles that have not been used for over 180 days and appear to be inactive.
An Excel sheet is attached with the full list of impacted roles. Each team can refer to the "xxx" column to identify and review the roles relevant to them.

Please review the roles under your respective ITEAM and let us know:
If any of these roles are still required, we will retain them as-is.
If they are no longer in use, kindly confirm so we can proceed with safe deletion.

Kindly share your feedback as soon as possible to help us move forward with cleanup.
